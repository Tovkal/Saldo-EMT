* Logging framework
* There are lot of prints that can be logs and errors. Maybe I should do a Error and pass a string to it
* db2json should upload result to AWS S3
* Add timestamp to db2json script to avoid parsing json if there are no changes
* Background fetch of new json file
* Remove iAd and search alternative
